# Mapping with Leaflet

Tailored Travel is in the process of building their new app to improve the traveler experience. You've been hired on as an independent contractor to handle the mapping and localization functionality for the app. One of the main features needed is for the user to be able to quickly locate local businesses. At the very least, the application must do the following:

Obtain the user's current location.
Map the location on a Leaflet map.
Allow the user to select a business type from a list and map the five nearest locations on the map using the Foursquare API.
